# pokemon-color-picker
A web app that retrieves a random Pokémon based off a given color.  Powered by the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/), a RESTful Pokémon API.

## Synopsis

Pokémon Color Picker is a simple, vanilla JS web application that retrieves data about a random Pokémon based off a user [specified color](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon-colors).

## Motivation

I am a child of the 90s. One of the first games I owned on my red Gameboy Pocket was Pokémon Yellow. I loved that game, and my love of it led to my love of the Pokémon TV series. Now as a parent, I get to watch the joy Pokémon brings to my children. 

I was recently reminded of the existence of [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). While poking around in the docs, I noticed an [endpoint for retrieving Pokémon colors](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2#pokemon-colors). Then, I got to thinking it would be a neat idea to combine that endpoint with a color wheel for selecting random Pokémon based off their colors. 

The main users for this application are my children. Building the application with them will be a nice medium for demostrating a type of project you can work on with programming.
